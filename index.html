    <h1>The International Workshop on Resource-efficient Mobile and Embedded LLM System in AIoT</h1>
    <p>
        The <strong>First International Workshop on Resource-efficient Mobile and Embedded LLM System in AIoT</strong>
        will be held in conjunction with <a href="https://sensys.acm.org/2024/">ACM SenSys 2024</a>.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) presents
        unprecedented opportunities for advanced data processing and analysis. As IoT devices continue to
        evolve, capable of processing data within constrained resources, the demand for real-time AI
        computation leveraging local sensory data while preserving data privacy becomes paramount.
        However, achieving an adaptive and reliable AIoT system that seamlessly integrates sensing and
        computing poses significant challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        This workshop proposal aims to address these challenges by focusing on the development of
        resource-efficient Mobile and Embedded Large Language Model (LLM) systems within the AIoT
        framework. We aim to explore strategies for maintaining system robustness in dynamic
        environments, optimizing resource and energy utilization in IoT devices, and updating AI models
        using local data. This workshop serves as a platform for researchers, system developers, and
        practitioners to engage in discussions surrounding the design, development, deployment, and
        operational hurdles of adaptive AIoT systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Contributions encompassing both theoretical and practical aspects are encouraged, including
        advancements in embedded and edge AI systems, on-device machine learning algorithms, and
        methodological considerations in AIoT systems. Join us in exploring the frontier of resourceefficient Mobile and Embedded Large Language Model Systems in the context of AIoT.
        Potential topics of intertest include, but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Intelligent Data Processing in AIoT</li>
        <li>Adaptive Sensing and Computing in Resource-Constrained Environments</li>
        <li>Real-time Computing and Data Privacy in AIoT</li>
        <li>Personalized AI Model Updates</li>
        <li>Computational Robustness in Dynamic AIoT Systems</li>
        <li>Energy-Efficient Designs and Strategies in AIoT</li>
        <li>Resource-efficient LLM Model</li>
        <li>Performance Optimization in AIoT</li>

    <p>
        As part of the ACM SenSys Conference, this workshop aims to address the emerging challenges
        and opportunities in resource-efficient mobile and embedded Deep Learning (DL) systems within
        the context of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). AIoT systems represent a convergence
        of AI and IoT devices, enabling intelligent perception and decision-making capabilities. However,
        traditional IoT frameworks often operate within rigid structures, limiting adaptability and hindering
        effective coordination between sensing and computation, especially in dynamic environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        This workshop focuses on enhancing the adaptability of AIoT systems through continual
        optimization of sensing and computing processes. By maximizing resource utilization and fostering
        self-evolving AIoT systems, we aim to improve real-time responsiveness and enable seamless
        integration of AI and IoT functionalities. The workshop seeks to explore innovative solutions that
        overcome the limitations of traditional IoT frameworks, paving the way for more responsive,
        adaptive, and intelligent AIoT systems.

    </p>
    <p>
        Researchers, practitioners, and industry experts are invited to contribute theoretical and practical
        insights to this workshop. Topics of interest include but are not limited to embedded DL systems,
        edge computing, on-device machine learning algorithms, and methodological advancements in
        resource-efficient AIoT systems. Join us in addressing the challenges and opportunities in resourceefficient 
        Mobile and Embedded Large Language Model Systems within the AIoT domain.
